# Regression on the tabular data
## Overview

In this project, I performed the tasks of to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features

I had a dataset (internship_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. I had to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features. 
In this case, I used such methods as LinearRegression(), train_test_split(), model.fit(), model.predict()

## I provide github repository that contains:
●	jupyter notebook with analysis (task3_done.ipynb); 
<br/> ●	code for modeling (task3_done.py); 
<br/> ●	file with model predictions (done.csv); 
<br/> ●	readme file (readme.md);
<br/> ●	requirements.txt file (requirements.txt).


## Requirements
All requirements are in the file requirements.txt
